# developer-hub-fastapi
A simple Fastapi application.<br>
I developed endpoints for creating a post, retrieving all and individual posts, and editing and deleting posts for a developer hub application.<br>
The developer hub application is a blog where developers post content on topics they are exceptionally good at in Programming.

 ## What I learnt:
 - creating a Fastapi application
 - setting up SQL Model
 - CRUD operations on a SQL database using SQLModel
